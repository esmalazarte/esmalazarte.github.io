			<p class="label">Nickname: Elijah</p>
			<p class="label">Favorite CMSC Subject:</p>
			<p class="paragraph">So far, CMSC 123 is what I liked the most since it deals
				with the more abstract and theoretical aspects of computer science. </p>
			<p class="label">Favorite GE Subject:</p>
			<p class="paragraph">ETHICS 1 is an intriguing subject as it considers something
				we take for granted like morality and questions it philosophically.</p>
			<p class="label">Favorite Programming Language:</p>
			<p class="paragraph">C is the ideal language to learn computer science for it
				only gives you basic functions to work with and does not spoonfeed you with
				premade algorithms (e.g. search and sort).</p>
			<p class="label">Favorite Food:</p>
			<p class="paragraph">None; once you eat enough of your "favorite" food, you would
				eventually start to get sick of it.</p>
			<p class="label">Hobbies:</p>
			<p class="paragraph">- Unlocking everything in a video game</p>
			<p class="paragraph">- Tinkering with obsolete computers</p>
			<p class="label">Childhood Dream:</p>
